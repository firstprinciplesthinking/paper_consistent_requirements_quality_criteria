"Software Requirement Third Edition, Karl Wiegers and Joy Beatty, 2013, p.204",Correct,"A low-level requirement that conflicts with its parent is not correct. To assess the correctness of user requirements, user representatives or their close surrogates should review them.",,
"Software Requirement Third Edition, Karl Wiegers and Joy Beatty, 2013, p.204",Feasible,"It must be possible to implement each requirement within the known capabilities and limitations of the system and its operating environment, as well as within project constraints of time, budget, and staff. A developer who participates during elicitation can provide a reality check on what can and cannot be done technically and what can be done only at excessive cost or effort. Incremental development approaches and proof-of-concept prototypes are two ways to evaluate requirement feasibility. If a requirement needs to be cut because it is not be feasible, understand the impact on the project vision and scope.",,
"Software Requirement Third Edition, Karl Wiegers and Joy Beatty, 2013, p.204",Necessary,"Each requirement should describe a capability that provides stakeholders with the anticipated business value, differentiates the product in the marketplace, or is required for conformance to an external standard, policy, or regulation.",,

"Software Requirement Third Edition, Karl Wiegers and Joy Beatty, 2013, p.204",Prioritized,"Prioritize business requirements according to which are most important to achieving the desired value. Assign an implementation priority to each functional requirement, user requirement, use case flow, or feature to indicate how essential it is to a particular product release. If all requirements are equally important, the project manager doesn’t know how best to respond to schedule overruns, personnel losses, or new requirements that come along. Requirements prioritization should be a collaborative activity involving multiple stakeholder perspectives.",,
WiegersBeatty_2013,Unambiguous,"Natural language is prone to two types of ambiguity. One type I can spot myself, when I can think of more than one way to interpret a given requirement. The other type of ambiguity is harder to catch. That’s when different people read the requirement and come up with different interpretations of it. The requirement makes sense to each of them but means something different to each of them. Inspections are a good way to spot ambiguities (Wiegers 2002). A formal peer review such as an inspection (as opposed to just passing out the requirements to individuals to examine on their own) provides an opportunity for each participant to compare his understanding of each requirement to someone else’s. “Comprehensible” is related to “unambiguous”: readers must understand what each requirement is saying. Chapter 17 describes the software peer review process. You’ll never remove all the ambiguity from requirements—that’s the nature of human language. Most of the time, reasonable people can draw the right conclusions from even a slightly fuzzy requirement. Getting a little help from your colleagues through reviews will clean up a lot of the worst issues, though.",,
WiegersBeatty_2013,Verifiable,"Can a tester devise tests or other verification approaches to determine whether each requirement is properly implemented? If a requirement isn’t verifiable, deciding whether it was correctly implemented becomes a matter of opinion, not objective analysis. Requirements that are incomplete, inconsistent, infeasible, or ambiguous are also unverifiable. Testers are good at examining requirements for verifiability. Include them in your requirements peer reviews to catch problems early.",,
WiegersBeatty_2013,Consistent,"Consistent requirements don’t conflict with other requirements of the same type or with higher-level business, user, or system requirements. If you don’t resolve contradictions between requirements before diving into construction, the developers will have to deal with them.",,
WiegersBeatty_2013,Consistent,Recording the originator of each requirement lets you know who to talk to if you discover conflicts. ,,
WiegersBeatty_2013,Consistent,"It can be hard to spot inconsistencies when related information is stored in different locations, such as in a vision and scope document and in a requirements management tool.",,
WiegersBeatty_2013,Modifiable,"You can always rewrite a requirement, but you should maintain a history of changes made to each requirement, especially after they are baselined.",,
WiegersBeatty_2013,Modifiable,You also need to know about connections and dependencies between requirements so you can find all the ones that must be changed together.,,
WiegersBeatty_2013,Modifiable,Modifiability dictates that each requirement be uniquely labeled and expressed separately from others so you can refer to it unambiguously.,,

WiegersBeatty_2013,Traceable,Note that you don’t actually have to define all of these trace links for a requirement to have the properties that make it traceable. Traceable requirements are uniquely labeled with persistent identifiers.,,
WiegersBeatty_2013,Traceable,"They are written in a structured, fine-grained way, not in long narrative paragraphs.",,
WiegersBeatty_2013,Traceable,"Avoid combining multiple requirements together into a single statement, because the different requirements might trace to different development components.",,
