# Process as a System III: Internally consistent quality criteria for requirements in systems engineering


**Author:** Jan Frank

**Abstract: Successful systems engineering projects ... well formed requirements. This paper establishes a unique set of quality criteria for requirements. Through interpretation of quality criteria as requirements for requirements, a self verification results in internally consistent quality criteria.** 

**Keywords:** Systems engineering, Requirement, Analysis
